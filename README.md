At present this plugin works, using my personal torbox key in vercel environment variables. The next steps to making it better are importing all of the series metadata and torrent hashes into the server.js file from https://github.com/fedew04/OnePaceStremio . I would like to eventually get this plugin to mirror the folder structure of that github but I am just using claude to hack my way through this so I don't really know how to do that right now. Next edits are going to be focused on getting the torbox authentication more secure so I can feel comfortable hosting this.
